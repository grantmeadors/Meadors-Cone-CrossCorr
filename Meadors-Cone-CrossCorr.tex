\maketitle

CrossCorr's 3D parameter space (frequency $f$, projected semi-major axis $a \sin i$, time of ascension $t_\mathrm{asc}$) includes a double-cone structure around simulated signals. 
On this cone, test statististc $\rho$ values are significantly higher than background, but less than the maximum. 
This structure can be considered a long-range correlation. 
While the metric approximation should not be expected to hold on the cone, the cone equation is derivable from degeneracies in the signal model. 
We illustrate this equation with figures and compare results to the corresponding $X$-pattern found in TwoSpect.

\section{Introduction}

A. Neunzert is currently investigating $X$-structures [LIGO-G1600577] in the TwoSpect pattern space that have been recently documented \hyperref[https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/33/10/105017]{[\textit{Classical and Quantum Gravity} \textbf{31} (2016) 105017]}.
Figure~\ref{TwoSpectGraph} illustrates such an $X$.
This structure is prominent in both the test statistic, $R$, and extrapolated single-template $\log_{10} p$-value (latter shown).
Here we note how investigations into CrossCorr [\textit{Physical Review D} \textbf{91} (2015) 102005] show that an analogous, conical feature exists for the test statistic $\rho$ in the ($f$, $a \sin i$, $t_\mathrm{asc})$ paremeter space.
While this long-range correlated structure should not be expected to be predicted by the metric approximation about peak $\rho$, it is a predictable consequence of the signal model.
Similar structures can reasonably be expected from other binary continuous-wave searches.

\section{Illustrations}

We take 2D slices through the 3D CrossCorr parameter space.
These dimensions are referenced by one-letter shorthand: F for $f$, A for $a_p$, T for $t_\mathrm{asc}$.
For ease of comparison, $\Delta f_\mathrm{obs} \propto a_p$ is actually graphed for A.
Each slice preserves F-A-T cyclic order, meaning that we graph the FA, AT, and TF planes along $xy$-axes.
Injection parameters are listed in Table~\ref{injection_table}; \texttt{lalapps\_Makefakedata\_v5} generated the injection.

Figures~\ref{FAcenterGraph},~\ref{ATcenterGraph}, and~\ref{TFcenterGraph} respectively depict the $f$-$\Delta f_\mathrm{obs}$, $\Delta f_\mathrm{obs}$-$t_\mathrm{asc}$, and $t_\mathrm{asc}$-$f$ plane through the center of an injection. 
The FA plane shows an $X$-pattern, AT an ellitical peak, and TF another $X$ pattern with a different slope.
The maximum of each pattern is at the center of each graph (the injection site).

\subsection{Slices through offset planes}

Slices through 5-bin offsets are also shown (\textit{c.f.,} \texttt{note-on-offsets.txt}) in Figures~\ref{FAoffsetGraph},~\ref{AToffsetGraph},~\ref{TFoffsetGraph}, in the same order as before.
The 5-bin offset is equivalent to

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta f$ (frequency) = $4.7 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz,
    \item $\delta \Delta f_\mathrm{obs}$ (modulation depth) = $6.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz,
    \item $\delta t_\mathrm{asc}$ (time of ascension) = $537$ s.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The FA plane shows a hyperboloid with transverse axis parallel to the $f$-axis, the AT plane an open ring with maxima along an ellipse with transverse axis parallel to the $t_\mathrm{asc}$-axis, and the TF plane another hyperboloid with transverse axis parallel to the $f$-axis.

\section{Interpretation}

The conic sections observed in Figures~\ref{FAcenterGraph} through~\ref{TFoffsetGraph} indicate that the three-dimensional surface of maximal $\rho$ is a double-cone, centered at the injection parameters.
Since the behavior of $\rho$ near the injection is well-described by the metric in the methods paper, let us focus on the extended cone.
When clarity is needed, true injection parameters are subscribed with zero (\textit{e.g.,} $f_0$).

In the FA plane, the $X$-slope $d \Delta f_\mathrm{obs} / df = \pm1$.
This slope is identical to the $X$ in TwoSpect.
Its origin is described in the TwoSpect directed methods paper.
To recapitulate, begin by considering the \textit{time-frequency} plane -- a spectogram, or plot of Short Fourier Transform bin powers over time -- of a solar-system barycentered signal.
When $f$ is offset by $\delta f$ and other parameters remain the same, the signal is lost.
However, if $\Delta f_\mathrm{obs}$ is also offset by $|\pm \delta \Delta f_\mathrm{obs}| = \delta$, then the maximum (or minimum) frequency of the signal, $f_0 \pm \Delta f_\mathrm{obs}$, will be sensed by a template. 
In units of projected semi-major axis,

\begin{equation}
\frac{d (a \sin i)}{d f} = \frac{c P}{2 \pi f}.
\end{equation}

Observe next the TF plane.
By similar, phenomenological reasoning, we infer that the $X$-pattern is the result of contact between the rising (or falling) edges of the template with the true signal. 
Offset $\delta t_\mathrm{asc}$ is compensated by shifting $\delta f$ so that the whole sinusoid moves parallel to the true signal.
We reason that the slope must be $\pm \max \left(d f / d t\right)$ (identical results are obtained, up to a sign, by extremizing $t_\mathrm{asc}$):

\begin{eqnarray}
  d(\mathrm{instantaneous frequency})/dt
      = d/dt (f_00 + (2 pi f_00 (a_p)/P) \sin[(2 pi/ P)(t - t_\mathrm{asc})])
      = (4 pi^2 f_0 (a_p)/P^2) \cos[(2 pi/ P)(t - t_\mathrm{asc})])
  \max(d(\mathrm{instantaneous frequency})/dt)
      := (df/dt)
      = 4 pi^2 f_0 (a_p)/P^2
      | f_0 = 100.015 Hz, a_p = 1.44 s, P = 68023.82 s,
      ~= 1.23e-6 Hz / s
      ~= 1 mHz / (1000 s)
\end{eqnarray}

This slope appears to be what we see in the TFresultsR graphs.

The reason for this slope and the X-pattern in the TF plane is best
visualized in the 1st Fourier domain of SFTs (as we think of it in
TwoSpect). There, the signal is a sine-wave with period = P, the orbital
period, centered on f0, with phase determined by Tasc.

If we try an offset template at f' = f+offset, leaving a sin i and Tasc
fixed, it will completely miss the signal. But it can still catch the
RISING edge of the signal's sinusoid if we shift the template orbital
phase: Tasc' = Tasc + $(df/dt)^(-1)$, where $(df/dt)$ ~ 1 mHz/(1000 s) in
our example. Likewise for negative offsets. Or, going the opposite way,
the FALLING edge of the signal can be caught. (signs hopefully right!)

Staying in the 1st Fourier domain, the circle in the AT plane is also
straightforward. For a fixed frequency offset, a template at Tasc', mod
depth = DFobs', can slide the point of contact between the template and
the true sinusoid signal by moving (Tasc', DFobs') in an ellipse. The
respective semi-axes at frequency offset "F\_offset" (F\_offset/$(df/dt)$,
F\_offset).

Conceptual note: we're used to thinking that all the power is in the
"horns", which is true when we sum over SFTs (project the sinusoid's
power onto the frequency dimension), but the instantaneous power in each
bin is relatively constant.

Putting all this together, the CrossCorr structure is a cone given by
the parametric equations [template frequency F', template mod depth
DFobs', template time of ascension Tasc']

\begin{eqnarray}
s \in (-\infty, +\infty), \theta \in [0, 2 pi)
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
F' - f0                        &=& s\\
DFobs' - (2 pi f0 (a sin i)/P) &=& s * 1 * \cos(\theta)\\
Tasc' - Tasc                   &=& s * (df/dt)^(-1) * sin(theta)
\end{eqnarray}

The middle equation could equivalently be written

\begin{equation}
Asini' - a sin i = s * P/(2 pi f0) * cos(theta)
\end{equation}

And the last expands to

\begin{equation}
Tasc' - Tasc     = s * P^2/(4 pi^2 f0 (a sin i)) * sin(theta)
\end{equation}

There are a few remaining subtleties. For example, $Tasc'$ will have to
start curving to follow large $F'$ offsets -- I'd guess the largest scale
structure in that dimension is actually sinusoidal with period equal to
orbital period $P$ and amplitude $(P/2)$.

To expand in small errors,

\begin{eqnarray}
f &\approx& f0 + err_f + (2pi f0/P)*[
                     (a sin i)*sin(Omega(t-Tasc)) \\
                   &-& err_a * sin(Omega(t-Tasc)) \\
                   &-& (a sin i) * Omega err_t] \\
                   &+& (2pi err_f/P)*(a sin i)*sin(Omega(t-Tasc))
\end{eqnarray}
  (take max)
\begin{eqnarray}
f &\approx& f0 + err_f + (2pi f0/P)*[
                     a sin i \\ 
                   &-& err_a * \\
                   &-& 2 pi (a sin i)/P * err_t] \\
                   &+& O(0)
\end{eqnarray}

Where we see that the ratios of coefficients are the same as above. Call
equal $\Delta f$ errors $eq_f, eq_a, eq_t$:

\begin{eqnarray}
eq_a / eq_f &=& P / (2 pi f0)\\
eq_t / eq_f &=& P^2/(4 pi^2 f0 (a sin i))
\end{eqnarray}

which are the same coefficients as obtained for $(Asini' - a sin i)$ and
$(Tasc' - Tasc)$ above, where we reasoned from the 1st Fourier domain.

Long story short: the structures make sense.

You're welcome to include any of this material on a wiki, though I do
not know where on the wiki to put it. Also, please let me know if this
is old news (and already covered in the iPython notebooks).

%My scripts are
%    \texttt{wrapCrossCorr.py}

NOTE: ADD material on why there are double-dots at $\pm$ some frequency around the central injection. My guess is that they are at one modulation depth away, and result from being in anti-phase somehow -- but it does not totally make sense. Investigate.
